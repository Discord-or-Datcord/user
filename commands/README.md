# Command Module

This module serves as the core component for handling commands in the Datcord project.

## Overview

The command module is designed to centralize command handling logic and provide a structured approach for integrating and managing commands across the application.

## Structure

The project follows a modular architecture where each command is developed as a separate module. This approach allows for:

- **Modularity:** Each command module can be independently developed, tested, and maintained.
- **Centralized Logic:** Command handling logic, such as parsing and execution, is centralized within the command module.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale by adding new commands as separate modules.

## Getting Started

To create a new command:
1. Create a new module with the root module as its parent.
2. Implement the command logic within the new module.
3. Ensure the new command module adheres to the interface and conventions defined in the command module.

## Usage

- **Integration:** Integrate commands by adding them as dependencies or dynamically loading them within the application.
- **Configuration:** Configure command settings and behavior within each command module.

## Contributing

Contributions to the command module and its associated command modules are welcome! Please follow the project's guidelines for contributing and maintaining code quality.
